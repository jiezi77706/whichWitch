## � Mvission

Build an on-chain creation platform for **recording**, **incentivizing**, and **tracing** every creation. Enable automatic authorization and revenue sharing for original works, safeguarding creators' income and fostering continuous creation and sharing.

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 🔗 On-Chain Creation Tracking
- Register original works on blockchain
- Create derivative works with parent-child relationships
- Build transparent creation genealogy

### 💰 Automatic Revenue Distribution
- Smart contract-based payment splitting
- **40%** to direct creator
- **40%** to original creator
- **20%** to middle ancestors
- Pull-based withdrawal pattern for gas efficiency

### 🎨 Creator-Friendly Workflow
1. **Upload** - Register original artwork on-chain
2. **Authorize** - Request permission to create derivatives
3. **Remix** - Create and register derivative works
4. **Earn** - Automatic revenue sharing across creation chain
5. **Withdraw** - Pull earnings anytime

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TailwindCSS
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet), Solidity
- **Web3**: Wagmi, Viem
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Storage**: IPFS (Pinata)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Smart Contracts

#### CreationManager
- Register original and derivative works
- Store creation relationships
- Track creator genealogy

#### AuthorizationManager
- Handle authorization requests
- Verify permissions
- Trigger revenue distribution

#### PaymentManager
- Receive and distribute payments
- Manage creator balances
- Handle withdrawals with platform fee (10%)

### Contract Interaction Flow

```
User (Register Original) → CreationManager.registerOriginalWork()
                          └─ Store work info

User (Request Auth) → AuthorizationManager.requestAuthorization()
                    ├─ CreationManager.getWork() [Query work info]
                    ├─ CreationManager.getCreatorChain() [Get ancestors]
                    └─ PaymentManager.distributeRevenue() [Split payment]

User (Register Derivative) → CreationManager.registerDerivativeWork()
                            └─ AuthorizationManager.hasAuthorization() [Verify auth]

User (Withdraw) → PaymentManager.withdraw()
                └─ Transfer balance
```

### Revenue Distribution Rules

| Scenario | Direct Creator | Original Creator | Middle Ancestors |
|----------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Original Work Authorization** | 40% | - | - |
| **1-Level Derivative** | 40% | 60% (40% + 20%) | - |
| **Multi-Level Derivative** | 40% | 40% | 20% (split) |
