## 🎯 Mission

Build an on-chain creation platform for **recording**, **incentivizing**, and **tracing** every creation. Enable automatic authorization and revenue sharing for original works, safeguarding creators' income and fostering continuous creation and sharing.

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 🔗 On-Chain Creation Tracking
- Register original works on blockchain
- Create derivative works with parent-child relationships
- Build transparent creation genealogy

### 🎨 NFT Work Ownership
- Mint NFTs representing work ownership rights
- Trade NFTs on integrated marketplace
- Instant royalty distribution to creator chain

### 💰 Dual Revenue System
- **NFT Sales**: Instant payouts (70% seller, 30% creator chain)
- **Authorization Fees**: Contract storage with 3.5% withdrawal fee
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Pay from any supported chain via ZetaChain

### 🎨 Enhanced Creator Workflow
1. **Upload** - Register original artwork on-chain
2. **Mint NFT** - Create ownership NFT (optional)
3. **List/Trade** - Sell NFT with automatic royalties
4. **Authorize** - Request permission for derivative creation
5. **Remix** - Create and register derivative works
6. **Earn** - Dual revenue streams (instant + stored)
7. **Withdraw** - Pull stored earnings anytime

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TailwindCSS
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet), Solidity
- **Web3**: Wagmi, Viem
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Storage**: IPFS (Pinata)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Smart Contracts v2.0

Six core contracts power the upgraded platform:

**Base Chain Contracts:**
- **CreationManager** - Registers works and tracks creation relationships
- **AuthorizationManager** - Handles authorization requests and verifies permissions  
- **PaymentManager** - Manages tips and authorization fees (stored in contract)
- **NFTManager** - ERC721 contract for work ownership NFTs
- **NFTMarketplace** - NFT trading with instant royalty distribution
- **RoyaltyManager** - Unified royalty distribution logic

**ZetaChain Contract:**
- **ZetaPaymentManager** - Cross-chain payment processor

### Contract Interaction Flow

```
User (Register Original) → CreationManager.registerOriginalWork()
                          └─ Store work info

User (Request Auth) → AuthorizationManager.requestAuthorization()
                    ├─ CreationManager.getWork() [Query work info]
                    ├─ CreationManager.getCreatorChain() [Get ancestors]
                    └─ PaymentManager.distributeRevenue() [Split payment]

User (Register Derivative) → CreationManager.registerDerivativeWork()
                            └─ AuthorizationManager.hasAuthorization() [Verify auth]

User (Withdraw) → PaymentManager.withdraw()
                └─ Transfer balance
```

### Revenue Distribution Rules v2.0
